## Description
*Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.*

## Branching Model
I use GitLab / GitHub Flow as branching model. The default branch is main. 

https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-gitlab-flow/
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow

Below is the workflow for adding new code:
1. Create feature branch
2. Make changes on this feature branch
3. Create a merge or pull request for merging feature to main
4. Delete your feature branch

## Contributing
Every feedback is appreciated.
